"""
Utility entry point that forces a data snapshot before the web server starts.

Usage:
    python -m webapp.manual_refresh

This helps environments where the automatic startup fetch (which uses
pyppeteer via requests-html) is blocked or requires additional time. Running
the command once will populate the cache so that the first HTTP request served
by the FastAPI app responds immediately.
